# ItemsForsale / StoryStuffSaved

https://storystuffsaved.com/

I had access to returned technology products at a highly discounted rate and made this site to sell them.

It's a 3-Page site; the 'Story' page describes the background story, the 'Stuff' page lists all the products for sale with filtering, and the 'Saved' page shows the user's saved products with a contact form.
